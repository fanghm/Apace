TODO:
---------
Display action
  - Add display filters: category, status...
    eg: Filter: [select field] [=|<>|...] [select value]  // for date field, select date range to filter
  - Expand each item to display update history, and can add a update from main UI conveniently
  - Load data on demand when switching tabs
  * Provide permlink of each action item (for mail link), can display/update separately (probably in a tab)

Add action
  - Data validation [x]
  - Make category/status definitions configurable
    - Read from config file [x]
    - Read from database, and allow to update from setting
  - Datetime picker for LE input [x]
  - Input assistence for owner field: either auto-complete, or search [x]
  - Verify owner is valid (for sending email notification) [x]
  - Display update history in list [x]
  - Apply different CSS on field labels to indicate non-mandatory fields

Update/Remove action
  - Basic [x]
  - Store update history as array, and display as list [x]
  - Add new update with fixed prefix of date and author's name, like '[2016/09/09] frank: ' [x]
  (partly dependent on user authentication)

Keyboard shortcuts support
  - '/': search [x]
  - ctrl + 'a': add    [x]
  - ctrl + 'e': edit   [ ]
  - ctrl + 'd': delete [ ]
  - 'k/j' or up/down arrow: select prev/next item [ ]
  - 'n/p' or page up/down: page up/down           [ ]
  - For modal:                                    [x]
    - ctrl + 'd': delete
    - ctrl + 's': save
    - ESC: close modal

Login and permission control
  - LDAP authentication [x]
  * Store user info in session for personalized display (my actions, pagination setting, ...)
  - Permission control: 
    - when add/editing action, if not login, redirect to login [x]
    - admin can update global settings like category/status definitions, default pagination setting
  - Login error removable with bootstrap alert
  * 'remmeber me' by cookie

Setting
  - category/status definitions
  - pagination setting
  - user default filter expression like "{category: 'CIF meeting', status: 'ongoing'}"

Mail Notification
  - upon action creation [x]
  - when due date is less than N(configurable) days (CC action creator)
  - when no update in N(configurable) days (CC action creator)
  - when owner changes (CC original owner)
  - to author: when status changed to Done/Blocked/... (configurable)
  * use better mail template

Others
  - app logo    [x]
  - favicon     [x]
  - Action update logging/history for audit?
  - SaaS
  - handle shortcut routes with in-built filters, for quick access, like "/cif" -> {category: 'CIF meeting'}
  - put name list in cache
  - check indexes on collections
  - disable DataTables warnings

Refactoring
  - put modal html into separate file
  - save action.author_id and history.by as ObjectId instead of name string, as user alias may change
  - only send updated fields to backend via ajax


Problems:
---------
  - Add action modal dialog always loading with previous data    [x]
  * The sequence number of new added item (may not be a problem) [ ]
  * Main tab not shown correctly user upon logout                [ ]
  - removeData() doesn't work
  * Render view error when input invalid owner email
